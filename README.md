# Simple Сalendar 
macOS Today Widget

## Description

Today extension for macOS Notification Center. The extension allows you to view and scroll quickly the monthly calendar.

Using Windows for a long time, I'm used to the fact that when you hover over the system clock, whole monthly calendar is displayed. Unfortunately, there is no such function on macOS 🤷.  
The system calendar widget displays only the current day, and you need to run the full calendar application just to see the current month.

The "Simple Calendar" widget solves this problem 👍.

## Requirements

macOS 10.15+ (Catalina)

## App Features

❤️ widget design matches macOS system design  
😉 easy to use    
⏱ saves you time  
🧚 reduces anxiety  

## To-Do

- [ ] localization (+🇷🇺, +🇪🇸)
- [ ] animation while scrolling
- [ ] to highlight selected date
- [ ] calculation of the interval between selected dates
